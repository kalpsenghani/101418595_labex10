# Redux JWT Authentication App

This application demonstrates a React app using Redux to manage authentication state with JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The app allows users to log in, and Redux handles the state management, including user information and authentication status.

## Features
- **User Authentication** with JWT
- **State Management** using Redux
- **Login & Logout** functionality
- **Responsive UI**

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** - Frontend framework
- **Redux** - State management library
- **JWT** - Authentication with JSON Web Tokens
- **React Redux** - Bindings for React and Redux
- **Redux Thunk** - Middleware for handling asynchronous actions
- **Axios** - HTTP requests for API calls


## Core Concepts of Redux in This App

### 1. **State**
   - **What it is**: The application’s state holds user-related data like authentication status, JWT token, and user details (e.g., name and email).
   - **In the App**: The Redux store manages the authentication state and stores the user's information once they log in.

### 2. **Store**
   - **What it is**: The Redux store holds the entire application’s state and serves as the source of truth for state management.
   - **In the App**: We create a Redux store using `createStore()` and pass the `authReducer` to it. The store is made available throughout the app using the `Provider` component from React Redux.

### 3. **Reducer**
   - **What it is**: A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action and returns a new state based on the action's type.
   - **In the App**: The `authReducer` listens for authentication-related actions like `LOGIN_SUCCESS` and updates the state with user information and the JWT token.

### 4. **Action**
   - **What it is**: Actions are plain objects that describe changes or events in the application, typically with a `type` and `payload`.
   - **In the App**: The actions in this app include `LOGIN_REQUEST`, `LOGIN_SUCCESS`, and `LOGOUT`. These actions trigger the authentication process, such as submitting the login form and handling successful login responses.

### 5. **Dispatch**
   - **What it is**: Dispatch is used to send actions to the Redux store, which in turn updates the state.
   - **In the App**: Components like the `Login` form dispatch actions such as `LOGIN_REQUEST` when the user submits their login credentials. The state is updated with user data once the login is successful.

### 6. **Subscribe**
   - **What it is**: Components subscribe to the Redux store to automatically receive updates when the state changes.
   - **In the App**: Components like `Dashboard` use the `useSelector()` hook to access the Redux state, ensuring that when the user logs in, the component re-renders with the updated user details.

### Login Flow

1. Open the application in the browser.
2. You will see the login page.
3. Enter your credentials (username and password).
4. If the credentials are correct, the user will be logged in, and their profile information will be displayed in the Dashboard.
5. Logout functionality is available to log out the user and clear the state.

## Explanation of Redux Flow

- **State**: Stores data such as user details and authentication status.
- **Store**: Holds the application's state and provides it to components via the `Provider`.
- **Reducer**: Defines how the state updates based on dispatched actions.
- **Action**: Describes the event (e.g., login or logout) that triggers state changes.
- **Dispatch**: Sends actions to the store to modify the state.
- **Subscribe**: Components automatically re-render when the relevant part of the state changes.

## Conclusion

This app demonstrates how Redux can be used to manage authentication state in a React app. By using Redux to handle actions, reducers, and state, the app ensures predictable state management and provides a clean separation between the UI and business logic.
